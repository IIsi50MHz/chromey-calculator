# Quick Tips #
  * Use up/down arrow keys to access input history.
  * Click on any result to insert it into the input area.
  * Ctrl+Click on any result to copy to clipboard.
  * Click the little arrow at the upper right to pop out to new window.
  * Last result can be accessed using the "@" variable.
  * Create your own user variables -- @abc\_123 = 42
  * Store an unevaluated expression -- @x := 10 meters
  * You'll see a faint "G" next to results caclulated by Google. Click the "G" to see the original Google result.

# Entering expressions #
## Basic examples ##
Many calculations are handled by Cloudy Calculator itself.
  * 2+2
  * 2`*`4
  * 100 - (1+2+5+7+11)`*`2.71828
  * 2 mi + 4 km + 3 lightyears in feet
  * 1/4 cup in tablespoons
  * cos(pi/2)
  * sin(60 degrees)
  * log(123)
  * ln(123)

## Google Calculator examples ##
When Cloudy Calculator can't do the job, Google Calculator handles the calculation.
  * 56 dollars in euros
  * 4 + 0xAF + 0o71 + 0b10 in hex
  * How old is Barack Obama?
  * Population of Seattle

Google Guide maintains an excellent list with many more examples: [Google Calculator (Cheat Sheet)](http://www.googleguide.com/help/calculator.html)

## Wolfram|Alpha examples ##
NOTE: Wolfram asked us to stop sending queries to them. (See comments for [issue 135](https://code.google.com/p/chromey-calculator/issues/detail?id=135) for details.)

~~If neither Cloudy Calculator nor Google Calculator comes up with a result, the expression will get sent on to Wolfram|Alpha. Wolfram|Alpha can handle things like derivative, integrals, equation solving, and vector arithmetic.~~

  * ~~d x^2 / dx~~
  * ~~integral x^2 dx~~
  * ~~solve(2 x^2 - 1 = 0)~~
  * ~~{1,2,3}.{1,2,3}~~
  * ~~{1,2,3}x{1,2,3}~~

~~Wolfram|Alpha maintains a huge list of examples: [Wolfram|Alpha Examples](http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/) (NOTE: Many, but not all Wolfram|Alpha queries are supported.)~~
