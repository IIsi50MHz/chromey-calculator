= Quick Tips =  
 * Use up/down arrow keys to access input history.
 * Click on any result to insert it into the input area.
 * Ctrl+Click on any result to copy to clipboard.
 * Click the little arrow at the upper right to pop out to new window.
 * Last result can be accessed using the "@" variable.
 * Create your own user variables -- @abc_123 = 42
 * Store an unevaluated expression -- @x := 10 meters
 * You'll see a faint "G" next to results caclulated by Google. Click the "G" to see the original Google result.

== Basic examples ==
Some basic calculations are handled by Cloudy Calculator itself.
 * 2+2
 * 2`*`4
 * 100 - (1+2+5+7+11)`*`2.71828

== Google Calculator examples ==
When Cloudy Calculator can't do the job, Google Calculator handles the calculation. Google can handle things like mixed unit calculations, unit conversions, currency converions, hex and binary arithmetic, trig functions, basic mathematical and physical constants, and much more.
 * 2 mi + 4 km + 3 light-years in feet
 * 1/4 cup in tablespoons
 * 56 dollars in euros
 * 4 + 0xAF + 0o71 + 0b10 in hex
 * cos(pi/2)
 * sin(60 degrees)
 * log(123)
 * ln(123)
 
Google Guide maintains an excellent list with many more examples: [http://www.googleguide.com/help/calculator.html Google Calculator (Cheat Sheet)]

== Wolfram|Alpha examples ==
NOTE: Wolfram asked us to stop sending queries to them. (See comments for issue 135 for details.)

~~If neither Cloudy Calculator nor Google Calculator comes up with a result, the expression will get sent on to Wolfram|Alpha. Wolfram|Alpha can handle things like derivative, integrals, equation solving, and vector arithmetic.~~ 

 * ~~d x^2 / dx~~
 * ~~integral x^2 dx~~
 * ~~solve(2 x^2 - 1 = 0)~~
 * ~~{1,2,3}.{1,2,3}~~
 * ~~{1,2,3}x{1,2,3}~~

~~Wolfram|Alpha maintains a huge list of examples: [http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/  Wolfram|Alpha Examples] (NOTE: Many, but not all Wolfram|Alpha queries are supported.)~~
